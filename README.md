- This project was a part of Portfolio exam for the module 'Data Visualization' in Master's of Data Science at Fachhochshule Kiel, Germany.
- The goal of this visualization project is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the complex issue of violence in New York City. By visually representing the data related to murders per 100 shootings in each borough, age and race distribution of perpetrators, shootings in each hour of the day, and months with the highest shootings, the project aims to:
    - Identify high crime areas 
    - Highlight demographic patterns
    - Identify temporal patterns
